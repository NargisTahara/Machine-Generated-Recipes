step
47-Remove the core from the cauliflower and cut it into large florets.-1-main
48-Peel and dice the potatoes. They are more dense than cauliflower, cutting them into a dice smaller in size than the cauliflower will ensure both cook evenly and be done at the same time.-2-main
49-Combine cauliflower & potatoes in a large pot & cover with cold water, add a heaping tablespoon of salt.-3-main
50-Bring water to a boil, reduce to simmer until the potatoes & cauliflower are fork tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain really well in a colander and return the potatoes and cauliflower to the hot pot that you cooked them in set on the stove (burner off). Setting them back on the stove, onto the hot burner will steam the remaining water off the vegetables.-4-main
51-In a small pan, warm the sour cream and butter. Add it to the potatoes along with the shredded cheese. With a potato masher, potato ricer or a hand mixer, mash/mix until they are well combined. If the potatoes need some extra moisture, add the milk.-5-side
52-Taste & adjust seasonings. Because the cheese is salty, you may not need any additional salt, but I always add a pinch of pepper.-6-side
