2. chop onions
3. Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry. Place shreds in a bowl, and mix in the onion, flour and egg until evenly distributed.
4. In a small pan, warm the sour cream and butter. Add it to the potatoes along with the shredded cheese. With a potato masher, potato ricer or a hand mixer, mash/mix until they are well combined. If the potatoes need some extra moisture, add the milk.
5. Taste & adjust seasonings. Because the cheese is salty, you may not need any additional salt, but I always add a pinch of pepper.

# green onions, 4.0 unit
# paprika, 0.0 ""


Instructions:

1. Remove the core from the cauliflower and cut it into large florets.
2. Peel and dice the potatoes. They are more dense than cauliflower, cutting them into a dice smaller in size than the cauliflower will ensure both cook evenly and be done at the same time.
3. Combine cauliflower & potatoes in a large pot & cover with cold water, add a heaping tablespoon of salt.
4. Bring water to a boil, reduce to simmer until the potatoes & cauliflower are fork tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain really well in a colander and return the potatoes and cauliflower to the hot pot that you cooked them in set on the stove (burner off). Setting them back on the stove, onto the hot burner will steam the remaining water off the vegetables.
5. At the same time, place eggs in another pot, and cover with an inch of water. Bring to a boil uncovered, and boil for three minutes. Cover the pot, and turn off heat completely for 10 minutes. Pour off the hot water, and soak the eggs in cold water until cool enough to peel.
6. Peel your cooked eggs, and cut them in half. Drop the yolks into the bowl your finished potato salad will go into.
7. Slice the green onions.
8. Add the mayonnaise, yogurt, mustard, salt, and pepper to the bowl with the egg yolks. Mash together with a fork until smooth. Stir in sliced green onions.
9. Chop egg whites, and add them to the mayonnaise mixture along with the cooked potatoes. Stir to coat. Sprinkle with paprika if desired. Serve immediately, or store in the refrigerator until ready to enjoy.
